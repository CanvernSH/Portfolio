# **Portfolio**

This is my portfolio showcasing some of my latest projects, along with a brief background on my education and experience. I’m constantly working on new projects, developing my software skills, and staying up to date with the latest technologies. Passionate about helping businesses scale through programming, I’ve completed Harvard’s CS50, an AWS Cloud Practitioner course, and have continued to grow my knowledge across a range of programming languages and frameworks. I’m excited to see where my career in software engineering takes me next.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and check out some of my recent work.
